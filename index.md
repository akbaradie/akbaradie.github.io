## [FIFA 21 Data Cleansing & EDA (PYTHON)](https://github.com/akbaradie/fifa21-cleaning-EDA)
FIFA 21 is an association football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts (EA), the game features more than 30 official leagues, over 700 clubs, and over 17,000 players. In this project, I did **data cleaning, data transformation, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis** to see features correlataion and distribution. Most of the work on this project uses **Pandas and Seaborn** library in **Python**.
