FIFA 21 is an association football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts (EA), the game features more than 30 official leagues, over 700 clubs, and over 17,000 players. In this project, I did data cleaning, data transformation, data visualization, and data analysis to see features correlataion and distribution. Most of the work on this project uses Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit.
